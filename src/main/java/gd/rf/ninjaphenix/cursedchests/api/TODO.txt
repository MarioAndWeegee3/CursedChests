real todo:
  Towelette support (when their api is released)
  Stair chests (should these be full blocks like old chests or indented like new blocks)

possible todo:
  Maybe add custom open stat for each chest type
  Curse of binding to lock a chest to a specific player (make upgrade ?)
  Trapped chest variant (make upgrade ?)
